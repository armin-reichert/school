\chapter*{Preface}

This book is in essence the second edition of the book Hotz/Walter,
''Automatentheorie und Formale Sprachen 2'', Endliche Automaten. As it has been
completely reworked, it really is a new edition.

While in the first edition only the theory of Finite Automata has been treated,
in this edition also an introduction into the theory of context-free languages
is given. This was only possible in the available space frame because
of an automata-theoretic treatment of the theory.

Such a foundation of the theory has already been proposed by Goldstine in 1977
and has been sketched in various of his lectures. The motivation for developing
my lecture, from which this book originates, in that way is nevertheless not
based on his proposal. It has almost automatically been arosen from the
work of the French school. I want to emphasize here the book by Jean Berstel on
transductions. Mr Berstel finally pointed my to the work of Goldstine.

I fully support Goldstine's opinion that it would be worth rethinking the whole
theory of formal languages along this automata-theoretic lines.

This book is only an introduction into the theory of formal languages. The
interested reader who wants to gets a deeper understanding of the theory or who
wants to get a different look into it is pointed to the books by Ginsburg,
Harrison or Salomaa. Relations to applications can be found in books on complier
design.

Dr.\ Klaus Estenfeld worked out my lecture ''Formal Languages 1'' which I held
on that topic in 1980/81 to become the foundation of this book and he made a number
of additions at some places.

Dipl.-Math.\ Bernd Becker carefully read the manuscript and contributed with his
proposals to the success of this book.

The publisher as well as the editors of the series earn our thanks for their
patience of waiting for the second edition.

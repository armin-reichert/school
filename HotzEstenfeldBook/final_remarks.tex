\chapter*{Final remarks}

Within the scope of this book, we could not handle efficient deterministic
algorithms for deciding the word problem of context-free languages though our approach 
strongly would suggest this.

As a follow-up to Shamir's theorem one can easily derive the
reduction of the word problem to the matrix multiplication as given by Valiant.

Our treatment of the 2-way finite automaton suggest the corresponding
generalization for automata with (monoid-) storage.

Also for linear-bounded automata and other machine models, our approach can be
applied without problems.

This composition of the theory shows in a new way the universality of the
syntactic monoid of the Dyck-language. This can also be manifested by some algebraic 
representation theorems \cite{Hotz81}.

It seems to be very promising to develop the whole theory of formal languages
under this point of view as has already been done by Goldstine
\cite{Goldstine77,Goldstine79,Goldstine80} at different places.
